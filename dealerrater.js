I feel like I spend months mentally preparing myself for the hassling experience. Thanks to Steven at LeSueur Car Company, I had a great experience! The entire staff was personable and approachable unlike your typical car salesmen who are usually dressed in suits getting ready to pounce on their prey. Steven was knowledgeable and extremely helpful. There was no high pressure sales and their vehicles are not over priced. I was also impressed with how inexpensive their service fee was compared to other competitors. On the last car I purchased, I spent around $700 on the service fee where I only paid $195 at LeSueur.\n\nI would highly recommend this family owed business to anyone in the market looking for a great buy!

Thinking this was a miss print my wife and I decided to just stop and take a look at the car. Steven greeted us after we arrived and I asked about the Hyundai, he was so great and laid back and just answered all my questions. Now I am one who loves to go to car dealerships and just ripe it up and get in the face and go toe to toe with the salesmen. Didn't need to at LeSueur as their prices where more then fair and I didn't feel like I was the next meal ticket. The whole process was so enjoyable that both myself and my wife found cars that we liked and so we ended up purchasing two cars, the Hyundai for me and a Black on Black Benz for my wife. When Steven was busy with other customers James stepped right in and helped out with the loan papers and he also took great care of us. Saving extra in taxes was nice also in the final price (LeSueur is in a township and they didn't have to charge for city tax).

We had previously been to the Toyota dealership here in Tucson where we live, and we had a very good idea of what we wanted, right down to year, mileage, color, interior, and the technology.\r\n Neither of us is experienced dealing with sales people at car dealerships, and I am sure the Toyota dealer we first went to thought we were ripe for exploiting; it certainly felt that way. The sales people there used every trick in the book to get us to buy something, anything, right down to the salesman bemoaning his fate, and saying that he had not made a sale for 9 days, and really, really needed to make this one. We got the barrage from all sides, and after 3 hours of this, we had simply had enough. Thankfully we had agreed with each other that we would not buy a car that day, just wanted to check it out, and we walked away without falling for the hype. The whole experience left a very sour taste in our mouths.\r\n When we saw the exact car we were looking for on LeSueur's site, I called them immediately, and got Kris on the phone at the weekend after hours. He sounded very welcoming, and we made an appointment to come look at the Prius first thing Monday, which we did. How glad we were!\r\n The whole vibe at LeSueur was so friendly, very welcoming, no hard-sell, and a genuinely pleasant experience. The price of the car was very good, and Kris took extra trouble to get our finances to work out how we wanted. The car itself had some defects in the paintwork, which Kris had pointed out on the initial phone call, and when he examined them, he said they would replace the whole front bumper assembly at their expense, rather than just take the cheaper option of touching up the paint. \r\n Both my wife and I were extremely impressed with everything to do with our experience there, we cannot recommend them highly enough!\r\n ","recommendDealer":"Yes","ratings":{"customerService":5,"quality":5,"friendliness":5,"overallExperience":5,"price":5}},{"id":"1123504","user":{"username":"pnklite","location":{"city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ"}},"dateWritten":"07/10/2013 12:06:44-04:00","employees":"Warren LeSueur, Steven LeSueur, James LeSueur","visitReason":"Sales (New)","comments":"I have bought two vehicles from LeSueur's, a Volkswagen Bug in 2006 and I just purchased a mini cooper.  This company can not be beat by any dealership in the United States.  They go beyond customer service, they do not pressure you or hang over every move you make like other sales people.  While I was sitting in the office with Steven, he had received two phone calls, and the integrity and honesty that he has just amazed me.  Offering to pick up a little lady and bring her there, the whole family is truly remarkable.  Warren is the founder and owner, and his sons, brother, nephews all work there and they are all just remarkable people.  I would strongly suggest to anyone looking for a car and a truly wonderful experience buying that car to go the LeSueur's.  I could go on and on but you truly should experience them yourself.

Not the only place, just the first, and ultimately, the last.  If all dealer car-buying experiences were like ours, shopping for a car would actually be fun.  Their inventory is comprised of quality vehicles, and they sell at very fair prices.  But that's only the start.  The quality of service (we added tint and a center console) is very high, and everyone we encountered during the experience was customer-centered.  It's great when everybody on staff is of the same mind - \"we're proud of what we do and we're here to make your experience a great one.\"  And I don't ever remember trusting a business like I do LeSueur.\r\n\r\nSeriously, next time I'm in the market for a car, this is the place I'll start.

All I ran into there was a bunch of guys telling me about how \"we deal in bulk\" and \"that's not my job, I'll find someone else to help you\".  That was not the case at LeSueur Car Company, a company I wasn't familiar with since I live and work on the west side of the valley in Surprise.  From the moment I stepped foot on the lot, 30 minutes after closing, and was able to look around the lot and test drive right away without any hoops or gimmicks I knew I had found a dealer I could trust.  Stephen pulled out his smartphone, snapped a picture of the VIN and was able to show me Carfax's right there on the lot, where at another dealership when I asked to see the Carfax I was told, \"Let me see if I can find a computer that has internet\".

And TTL was 1/2 what other dealer quoted!

Very low pressure sales style, very consultative and guiding. We had been shopping for a VW Sportwagen TDI for about a week, and there are a limited number of them available in the Phoenix area. I attempted to buy one from another dealer, only blocks from LeSueur and felt the sales tactics cramping my decision. When I found a car at LeSueur via Craigslist, I emailed a low ball offer and got an email back the following day asking if I had some room to play with the offer (aka. I had gone a little to low). I finally stopped in to meet Kyle, and check out the car. Our first meeting ended, with a stalemate on the price point. Not because Kyle hadn't tried aggressively with the pricing, but simply because it was a touch out of my price range. A few hours later, Kyle called me and gave it one last effort, if I brought $1K more to the down payment, they would come down in the price and it would get the monthly where I needed it. It wasn't so much a big discount, it was just an honest effort at working out the numbers to help me get to a payment and term that I felt comfortable with. Then I made one more request to have the car tinted, and Kyle agreed. It was a very pleasant transaction, very friendly shop, very nice and clean dealership too!

However, this dealership acutally was able to purchase some over stocked Tacoma's from a local Toyota dealer so I was in luck and didn't have to go to a big, corporate dealer.  I also, usually never trade in cars but made an exception.  The guys here worked with an independent BMW dealer to get me the best possible price for my beloved 2008 BMW M3.  Because my car was worth more than a the new truck, I actually saved a bunch of money because I didn't have to pay any tax and even received money back.  Ryan took the time to explain that by doing the deal this way, it actually netted me more money than what I could have recevied by selling it myself.  Ryan stayed passed closing time to finalize the deal and was very efficient.

After the visit, I received a timely email thanking me and to my surprise I received a personalized email about a week later from Kris LeSueur who'd helped me that day. I wasn't even aware he was the general manager of the dealership until I read the email. He was very friendly and approachable. Some meaningful question and answer emails followed and I went back to look at the 2 cars that I was most interested in. Though I ended up buying a Mini at a different dealer, I actually felt guilty given how helpful Kris and his brothers were on my visits. Truth be told, I got a fantastic deal on a car that was destined for auction elsewhere or I would have purchased from LeSueur. On my second visit Kris also mentioned how qualified they were as a repair facility. After purchasing my Mini, I opted to change the rims and tires. The tire dealer wasn't able to adjust the alignment because it requires a special wrench so I called the dealer and was shocked at the price. At that time I remembered my conversation with Kris LeSueur and how many Mini's they have on their lot and decided to look at the service portion of their website. Their alignment service was about a third of the price of the Mini dealer and used the most current technology. They even accommodated my appointment need which was later than normal. Ken in service was very helpful and friendly. Turns out they have to weight down the car to do a proper alignment and Ken showed me the discrepancy between the tire dealer's results and theirs which was done to factory specs. I've owned about 15 cars and have done a fair amount of my own work in the past. This has been the best dealership experience I've had, equivalent to the Lexus dealer but without the sandwiches and drinks :-).

They took me into a room, and shoved a piece of paper across the table to me with a bunch of numbers on it, huge amounts of fees, and other misc  costs on it. I asked for my keys, and got up to leave, walked out of the office, with the sweating sales guy following me. I had to ask for my keys 3 times before they would give them to me, then I had 3 guys chasing after me out to my car. Then the phone calls started from them. Needless to say, I ended up back at LeSueur a couple of days later. I dealt with Ryan Biggs, and he was super cool, laid back, once again no pressure, let me test drive, and I ended up purchasing my Toyota Prius from them. It was a seamless deal, they made it so easy. Hey, and the best thing is I totally love my Prius II. I am from Cali, and gas prices are crazy out here compared to Phoenix, so I bought the right car, and its much more expensive to buy a Prius out here, its the \"IT\" car out this way. \r\nIn a nutshell, if you want a great car, no hassles, and to deal with the nicest guys ever, head over to LeSueur Car Co. They know what they are doing, and I can't say enough great things about them.

No pressure from the sales staff and Kris was very helpful explaining the operating system.  Must explain, I'd been driving a 1990 Nissan pickup for 18 years so it didn't have any modern features. All the buttons and electronics were baffling.  After test driving two Mini's I decided I wanted the Convertible S model but I had specific features I wanted.  Explained to Kris I wasn't interested in the models I drove but if they ever had what I wanted to give me a call.  He looked in his data base, and there it was. A 2006 red Mini S convertible manual 6 speed with heated seats.  It was in beautiful condition, price was in my range.  Kris allowed me to keep the car for several hours to really check out the performance and condition.  The price we agreed on was great.  The car had one minor problem and they replaced the part before I picked up my \"new\" car.  Kris also introduced me to the service manager.  Was told if I had any questions to call or bring car in and they'd explain.  Kris remembered the former owner had additional operating information so Kris contacted me two days later with that information.  I was very satisfied with the overall buying procedure. Based on the purchasing experience I will be using their maintenance/repair department.

Fantastic photos, info on standard vs options etc was differentiated and complete, free full car fax and pricing is already below KBB full retail.

We picked it  up a couple of days later and we were in and out of the dealership within an hour. It was great. I HIGHLY reccomend this place to anyone looking for a great deal.

The representatives were friendly and knowledgeable, but most importantly they were respectful. \r\n   Most car dealers today employ pushy salespeople or have policies that encourage their salespeople to just sell their cars - get 'em off the lot, with little regard for the buyer. The typical first question from them is, \"What is your monthly payment.\" Then they'll often use every deceitful tactic in the world to keep you at the dealership until you buy a car from them. It's worse than having a root canal. People hate buying a car.\r\n   Conversely, the folks at LeSueur are more interested in what the buyer wants in a car. They listen and work with the buyer to find the best match. They help find financing and go out of their way to explain everything. There are no pushy salespeople at LeSueur, they are just folks who want the buyer to have a good buying experience. Furthermore, the vehicles at LeSueur were very clean, top quality cars. There are many very nice VW's, Coopers, Volvos, along with an assortment of Japanese or Korean brands. \r\n  The bottom line is if you're looking for a good late model used car for a fair price and are tired of dealing with pushy car salespeople, then you should visit LeSueur Car Company.

The same day I drove the car off the lot a 'service now' light came on, and lastly the ipod cable was bad.\r\n\r\nAll the above items were corrected at Berge VW and Mike took great care of me. It must be noted that I was referred to Berge by Ryan, and they did contribute $50 towards the 2nd key which needed to be re- programmed.

I was impressed with how \"matter of fact\" Ryan was and let me off the phone without trying to sell me a truck that I didn't want.

My husband and I went by to check out the trucks and found the perfect one at a reasonable price.  We didn't want to hang around and spend out precious Saturday at a car dealership, so Ryan suggested that we put down a minimal deposit and that he would have the paperwork complete the day we requested.  True to his word, he had the truck out front waiting for us and it took no time to sign the prepared documents.  WOW!  Ryan has a great sense of humor  and the experience was pleasurable.

I really wanted a TDI... I originally went to LeSueur Car company to look at a used TDI that they had listed on car.com, but it was not what I hoped. Then we looked at a wagon with all the bells and whistles but it was a little more than I wanted (could) spend. Joe was excellent to work with and he encouraged us to drive the cars we were looking at. When we got back and were chatting he said they just got another wagon but it wasn't out on the lot yet. He took as back to show us the car and encouraged us to take it for lunch (we were getting hungry about now) so we did. It was excellent. Low miles, clean. And the right price for me. Joe said he would take care of everything. He took care of getting the plates, working with the bank, etc. He was able to dropped the car of for window tint and even took it to the dealership for its scheduled oil change before I came back to pick the car up. On that note, he said that we could take the car that day but I was in no hurry, but if you wanted a car now, there is no doubt that Joe could get you a car now. It was a no pressure friendly sale. Before LeSueur, I test drove 13 other cars at many different dealerships... getting a new car should be exciting and fun... it wasn't. It was stressful and it down right sucked (not all dealerships, but at most). \r\n\r\nI am writing this review after owning the car for about 2 months. I don't ever write reviews right away as I want to see what happens and how I feel later after the purchase. I am very happy. When I bought the car, it was missing a key remote (an expensive item) and they got for more me, hassle free.\r\n\r\nI still want that TDI with that sweet moon roof...

So I decided to visit this dealership.\r\n\r\nSteven LeSueur assisted me when I arrived.  I have never owned a VW before so Steven took the time to show me various models and explain the attributes and details.  The following day we returned to test drive different models.  All of the vehicles we drove were in very good condition and clean.  Steven was very supportive and encouraged us to test drive as many vehicles as needed to make a decision.  Ultimately we chose the CC and are very pleased with our decision.  We also traded in a vehicle and were pleased with quote.\r\n\r\nAfter dealing with the pressures and game playing at the new-car dealerships, working with Steven at LeSueurs was a refreshing change.

Not only did we buy our Passat from LeSueur back in 2003, but they have serviced it, as well as our children's and friends' cars over the years.  We constantly refer people to them because not only did we purchase a great vehicle for a great price, we also found hard-working, family-oriented, friendly and honest salesmen and mechanics for life.  Robb, Jack, Phil and past mechanics have always been able to quickly troubleshoot problems, prepare estimates, and complete repairs as promised, at the prices promised.  They didn't have to, but they willingly dealt directly with our insurance company after an undercarriage accident led to a mechanical problem.  And there is never any pressure, in sales or service.  If there is something my husband feels he can do on his own, they will make suggestions and/or tell him where he can find the parts he may need.  Appointments are easy to make, yet they are also there for us when we drive up unannounced with a simple issue, such as checking a warning light or code.  Recently, when I asked for a ride to the nearest light rail station, they insisted on driving me all the way home instead.  Everybody at LeSueur is just great and they go the extra mile for their customers -- the mechanics mentioned above, and Kris, James, Steven and both Ryans, to name a few.  Even the detail team is wonderful, for doing even the littlest things, like bringing our headlights back to life.

Fuel economy was paramount for me, as my commute is 120 mi/day. I couldn't justify paying the price of admission for a Toyota Prius, and have already played (and paid) for the new car smell.  So I dropped by LeSueur Car Company on my way home from work to have a look around.\r\n\r\nMy car was on the lot, equipped as advertised. Before long, I met Ryan. He quickly recognized that I had already done my homework, and offered a test drive.  To my surprise, Ryan handed me the keys and advised me to let him know when I returned.\r\n\r\nI have been driving manual transmission cars all my life, but I stalled the Honda before I got out of the dealership lot. The electronic throttle took a little getting used to. Still, no one ran out of the office with second thoughts about my test drive.\r\n\r\nDriving by myself, I was able to completely focus on how the car drove, how the seat felt, the button and control placement, instrumentation, and how the car sounded at various speeds.  No chatty sales pitch to disrupt my 'test' drive.\r\n\r\nUpon my return, Ryan and I entered the office to work up some numbers.  Being a Saturn driver, I appreciated his no pressure, no hassle approach. \r\n\r\nBefore long, an equitable deal was struck.  I called my credit union of 20 years to arrange for financing, only to find out that, although my credit rating was stellar, I had too much available credit.  My 20 years of responsible banking and multiple loans with them, paid in full, meant nothing.  \r\n\r\nDisappointed and somewhat embarrassed, I advised Ryan of my situation.  No worries.  Only then did Ryan involve a colleague to assist with some potential financing.  No bait-&-switch or wear-down tactics. Another credit union was tapped, and the loan docs were drawn up.\r\n\r\nOne final detail, a quick check on my auto insurance provider's website for necessary details, and I was handed the keys to my 'new' 10,000 mi car.  To this day, I have had absolutely no trouble with my Honda.  No surprises, no red 'check engine' lights, no nothing.\r\n\r\nMy experience at LeSueur was exactly what I was looking for. Quality, affordable, low-mileage transportation at a fair price.  What my experience didn't include was having to remember the names of 4 sales guys, 2 finance girls and a warranty specialist.\r\n\r\nIf you want trendy furniture, bright lights, and a neck massage, LeSueur is probably going to disappoint.

His positive and non-aggressive attitude made me feel comfortable looking and eventually purchasing a vehicle. I had been to 4 other car dealerships in the past 2 weeks and had spent countless hours researching vehicles until I found the vehicle I was looking for at LeSueur's. Steven showed great patience, allowing me to wait for a friend to arrive to test drive the vehicle as well as answering in detail to any question I had,and then finally down to the financing and purchasing of the vehicle. The most stressful time of searching for a car is when it's time to talk about actually buying the car. He turned his computer monitor so that we could see everything he was typing and then in detail explained how we got to the final cost of the vehicle. At the other dealerships I was forced to deal with a \"middle-man\" who was running back and forth explaining to me why her boss could not budge on the price, and that the additional $2500 was your standard tax, doc fees, titles, and processing fees. LeSueurs understands the importance of saving customers money, and has a standard $180 processing fee, instead of the $500-600 fee found at the majority of the bigger dealerships. Also they do not have a city tax which saved me quite a bit of money. My previous car was purchased from small dealership up in cave creek.

Well that was prior to working with David Tracy at LeSueur Car Company.  I purchased a 2008 Mini Cooper about 4 months ago.  The experience was painless, David was extremely patient as I drove car after car trying to find something I liked.  I finally drove the Mini and decided that was the car for me.  A few months after I purchased the Mini I started to have \"buyer remorse\".  Let me clarify, there was nothing wrong with the car, the remorse was all me.  Oh sure it was cute, but it wasn't practical for me.  I emailed David and whined that I didn't really like my Mini anymore.  He was very understanding and did all the leg work a head of time on figuring out what cars on the lot fit my needs and my budget.  I showed up and test drove the cars he picked out for me.  None of them \"wowed\" me.  I mulled over a Nissan Ultima but wasn't thrilled about the color of the car.  So after spending several hours driving vehicles and driving David insane I got back in the Mini and drove away.  I was trying to convince myself to love my \"mistake\" of a car.  3 weeks later I was once again down at LeSueur, boyfriend in tow who was completely annoyed with me, and the fact it was 111 degrees out and I thought I once again needed to shop for a car.  We test drove a bunch more vehicles and the last one I drove just before they were ready to close was a 2009 Jetta.... I loved it!  Of course now it was after closing, yet the salesmen stuck around trying to do all the paperwork for me.  They couldn't get the financing that night but promised me Monday morning they would work on it.  9:30 on the dot David called, he had finished the financing, got me a lower interest rate, got me a plate credit for the mini and just needed me to sign and pick up the car.  I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a used car.  They are friendly, helpful, honest, and have integrity that you just don't find at other dealers.

The moment we drove onto their lot, we knew LeSueur was a step (or 10) above everyone else. There weren't a bunch of salesmen milling around the front of the building like a pack of vultures waiting to pounce on their next victim. We were able to look at all the cars we were interested in without having a salesmen watching our every move, but when we were ready to talk to someone, David was right there. He never once pressured us to buy a car and his only question to us was \"What other questions can I answer for you?\". And he was far more knowledgable about VW's than all the other salesmen we'd talked to combined. They also have VERY reasonable prices in their service department, which we were very happy with. \r\nMy husband is in the military so we move around frequently, but we would both be willing to fly back to Phoenix to buy our next car from LeSueur Car Company.

I had read many positive reviews on this site about the LeSueur Car Company in Tempe, Az as well as finding out that they have an A+ rating with the Arizona BBB. So, I decided to give them a try.\r\n     I arrived late in the afternoon and the first thing I noticed was that they were quite busy and that's a good thing if you are in the car business these days. I was then greeted by a young fellow named JT, who I later found out is the youngest member of the LeSueur family. He asked me if I needed any help and I said well I came to look at some VW's and that he was welcome to come with me if he wanted. He obliged and I found the car that I was looking for. I just sat in it for a couple of minutes and JT asked if I wanted to drive it and I said there was no need, I would like to purchase the car.\r\n      I was treated extremely well by the entire LeSueur team and the car buying process was pretty much a breeze. I also think that I received a very a good deal on the purchase price of my 2007 VW Rabbit. Kris, David, and JT made me feel comfortable and for me that is a big thing as the car buying process usually sends me almost into a panic attack. I know I am leaving some people out as I am not that good at remembering names, but I would like to say that everyone at the LeSueur Car Company were fantastic and when I need to replace my 2007 VW Rabbit, I will definitely be coming back. I will also highly recommend them to my friends and coworkers as well.\r\n     Awesome job everyone!!!

We had a terrible experience with that Acura dealership and found ourselves forced to go looking for an alternate vehicle. We went to see the LeSueur car company after noticing some of their advertisements on the Internet. At first sight the lot was not very impressive, but once we drove in and saw their inventory we began to change our minds. We found several VW Passat station wagons that caught our interest and stopped to look at them. A friendly young gentlemen named Ryan Biggs stopped to say hello on his way past us in the lot and offered to bring us some water (it was extremely hot outside!!) and to get us some assistance if we wanted it. That was the beginning of probably my most pleasant car buying experience that I've ever had. This dealership is a true team effort. Everyone works together and helps each other out. It is one big family team, with \"adopted\" family members such as Ryan all seeming to take an active part and working well together. Their small office was packed solid with happy customers making deals while we were there. Because we are Canadian and were taking the vehicle back across the border with us within a few days we did need some special consideration, and the staff accommodated all of our needs without hesitation. I would not hesitate to send other customers to LeSeuer Car Company and will definitely consider them again whenever I need a new vehicle in the future.

We went to several new car dealerships in town, and ALL of them were staffed by the typical semi-coked up-two packs a day-way to much coffee-useless tool, trying to sell you a car by reading the window sticker. and when you asked about finances they always walk away, have another smoke, talk to their manager, and come back with a scribbled on piece of paper. when you get frustrated enough because they are not listening to you, then the \"manager\" comes over and tries to bully you into something. At a camelback dealership when this happened the manager asked \"What will it take for you to consider buying a car today?\" my wife replied. \"Let us leave for starters.\" and we left.\r\n\r\nThat is when we decided to go out and visit LeSueur Car Company. In this time of internet savy shoppers, it is not hard to quickly find the deal you are looking for, at a price you feel is right. In shopping for a new beetle, LeSueur kept comming up with the best deals in town. \r\n\r\nWe went out to check them out. The dealership is not much to look at with the dirt lot and \"rustic\" office environment. But, the people working here are FIRST RATE. David met us on the lot and the first thing he asked was \"Do you guys want some water?\" (in phoenix in July, it is HOT HOT HOT) He then asked us if we were interested in anything in particular and invited us out of the heat to search their inventory. \r\n\r\nDavid was completly aware of his inventory, and everything about each car on the lot. With regard to VW's (new and old) he knew all the variations in models, what year changed what, and the good and bad of each engine type, etc. He asked if we had ever driven a new beetle, and offered to bring one up, and cool it down inside before we test drove it.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait for a settlement to come in from our previous (totaled) car, before we could buy, so I started the finance process at my local bank. \r\n\r\nWhen we came back to buy a car, we knew exactly what we wanted, and David took us out to the lot to choose one from 3 avaialble. This dealership has the largest stock of used beetles around! we test drove the car, loved it, and started the purchasing process. \r\n\r\nThis is where David really shined. we told him we were putting cash down, and that I had prequalified through my credit union for what I thought was a pretty good rate. He saw the rate and very nicely commented that I was welcome to use my bank if I had my heart set on it, but he was certain he could get me a better rate. A quick credit check later and he had a rate 2.25% BETTER than the rate from my bank. The whole process was up front and straight forward. David made sure we were aware of all the possible savings we could get He handled all the licensing issues and insurance issues. The whole time making sure we understood what he was doing and showing us how he was doing it. \r\n\r\nIt was the most comfortable car buying experience I have ever been a part of.\r\n\r\nI am recomending David and the LeSueur Car Company to all my friends for their next car!

For example, I had my car into service at another bigger chain type dealer and not even two minuets into looking at the cars I saw an eager salesman approaching asking me what I wanted to buy who then proceeded to take me inside to talk figures. There is NONE of that at LeSueur. The staff are exceptionally knowledgeable, but more importantly they know that people don't jump on the first car they find on the internet. They let you look and when you find something interesting they let you test drive it with no strings attached! I am the prime example because in the two years I looked I test drove 13 cars before I finally made my decision. This shows you the extreme patience and understanding they have when it comes to individual buyers. I can't believe what an easy-going environment they have at LeSeuers!

The price of the car wasn't 14,995 it was 14,495. If i decide to buy another VW in the near future this will probably be the first and only place i will look. I will gladly drive 100 miles for such great service!","recommendDealer":"Yes","ratings":{"customerService":5,"quality":5,"friendliness":5,"overallExperience":5,"price":5}}]});
